# ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange

# Problem Statement

Develop ReWear, a web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. The goal is to promote sustainable fashion and reduce textile waste by encouraging users to reuse wearable garments instead of discarding them.
